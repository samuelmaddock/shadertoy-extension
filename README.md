# ShaderToy Extension (WIP)

Chrome and Firefox extension to run ShaderToy shaders on any non-DRM-enabled web video. Press the extension badge to inject a video filter into the page.

[ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) is an awesome website for sharing graphic shaders. This extension aims to allow running singlepass shaders on web video streams.

## Limitations

This is hardcoded to only support on shader at the moment. See `background.js` for more info.
